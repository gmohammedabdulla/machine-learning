# machine-learning
This repo has implementation of various machine learning algorithms written while learning. Following are the Algorithms:

1. Linear Regression - Naive implementation, Vectorised implementation, model to predict house prices
2. Binary Logistic Regression - Sigmoid Activation
3. Multiclass Logistic Regression - With Softmax as output layer
4. Neural Network - Both Sigmoid and Relu activation fuction

APIs are similar to SkLearn standard API format.
